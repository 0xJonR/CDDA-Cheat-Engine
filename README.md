idea: make a cheat engine for CDDA that allows one to change properties of things

start SMALL: guns & armor only

    * = core 
    ** = core+
    *** = planned 


--------Tech used---------------------------------------------
    * Scala - Multiplatform, assume ran in cdda directory
    * ScalaJS - Loading and writing into cdda's json 
    ** ScalaFX - multiplat GUI 
    ** sbt-assembly - publish one fat jar for everyone to use  

--------Features--------------------------------------------     
    * = Change damage of guns/bows/melee
    * = offer backups
    * = offer quick-buffs/nerfs
    ** = Change save game data
    ** = Change save game character attributes
